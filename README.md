# ML-Model-Deployment-using-Flask

In this regression task we will predict the percentage of
marks that a student is expected to score based upon the
number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear
regression task as it involves just two variables.

## Verified the assupmtions of Linear regression.

The regression model is linear in parameters.
The mean of residuals is zero.
Homoscedasticity of residuals or equal variance.
No autocorrelation of residuals. ...
The X variables and residuals are uncorrelated.
The variability in X values is positive.
The regression model is correctly specified.
No perfect multicollinearity.

## Deployment in Heroku using Flask

By deploying models, other systems can send data to them and get their predictions, which are in turn populated back into the company systems.
